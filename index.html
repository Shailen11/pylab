              Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. <br><br>

              Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br><br>
                <p>List Items <br>
                  List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. <br><br>
                  
                  List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
              
              Lists are created using square brackets:</p> <br><br>

            <p id="DataAnalytics">DataAnalytics <br>Data analytics is the process of exploring and analyzing large datasets to make predictions and boost data-driven decision making. Data analytics allows us to collect, clean, and transform data to derive meaningful insights. It helps to answer questions, test hypotheses, or disprove theories. 
              </p>
              <p>Applications of Data Analytics</p>
              <p>1.Data analytics is used in the banking and e-commerce industries to detect fraudulent transactions.</p>
              <p>2.The healthcare sector uses data analytics to improve patient health by detecting diseases before they happen. It is commonly used for cancer detection.</p>
              <p>3.Data analytics finds its usage in inventory management to keep track of different items.</p>
              <p>Data Analytics Process Steps</p>
              <p>1.Data Collection: The first step in data analytics is to collect or gather relevant data from multiple sources. Data can come from different databases, web servers, log files, social media, excel and CSV files, etc.</p>
              <p>2.Data Preparation: The next step in the process is to prepare the data. It involves cleaning the data to remove unwanted and redundant values, converting it into the right format, and making it ready for analysis. It also requires data wrangling.</p>
              <p>3.Data Exploration: After the data is ready, data exploration is done using various data visualization techniques to find unseen trends from the data.</p>
              <p>4.Data Modeling: The next step is to build your predictive models using machine learning algorithms to make future predictions.</p>
              <p>5.Result interpretation: The final step in any data analytics process is to derive meaningful results and check if the output is in line with your expected results.</p>

            <p id="Quan_Qual">Quan_Qual <br> 1.Quantitative analysis is often associated with numerical analysis where data is collected, classified, and then computed for certain findings using a set of statistical methods. Data is chosen randomly in large samples and then analyzed. The advantage of quantitative analysis the findings can be applied in a general population using research patterns developed in the sample. This is a shortcoming of qualitative data analysis because of limited generalization of findings.
              </p>
              <p>2.Qualitative analysis is concerned with the analysis of data that cannot be quantified. This type of data is about the understanding and insights into the properties and attributes of objects (participants). Qualitative analysis can get a deeper understanding of “why” a certain phenomenon occurs. The analysis can be used in conjunction with quantitative analysis or precede it.
